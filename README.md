# ExpandTesting Automation Project

Welcome to the ExpandTesting Automation project! 
This project is designed to help you practice and improve your automation testing skills using various tools and techniques.

The project includes a set of test cases for the ExpandTesting Automation website, which offers demos and examples for UI and API using various tools such as Selenium, Webdriver and Postman.

The test cases cover various scenarios, such as login functionality, home page functionality and Search functionality.

The goal of these test cases is to ensure that the website is functioning as expected and provides a seamless user experience.

# Requirements
  
  * Expand Testing website URL: https://practice.expandtesting.com/
  * Login Credentials :
    
                * Username : practice
                * Password : SuperSecretPassword!

  # Tech stack Requirements :

   * IntelliJ Idea IDE
   * Programming language - Java
   * Automation framework - Selenium
   * Testing framework - TestNG
   * Project management tool - Maven

 #  Design Patterns:

  * Page Object Model (POM)

# Getting Started

   * Set up your test environment by creating a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
   * Add the necessary dependencies to your project, including the Selenium WebDriver and ExpandTesting Plugin.
   * Create a new Java class for your test.
   * Set up the desired capabilities for your test, including the platform, version, and name.
   * Connect to ExpandTesting using your access key and the RemoteWebDriver.
   * Navigate to the (https://practice.expandtesting.com/) website using the WebDriver.
   * Perform actions on the website as needed.
   * Quit the WebDriver when you are finished.


# Tests:

 ## Login functionality
 
  * T1: Confirm that logging in with valid credentials is successful.

  * T2: Confirm that logging in with invalid credentials fails.

 ## Home Page functionality
 
 * T1: Test for the presence of the search box on the homepage


## Search functionality

* T1: Test for searching an example using search functionality and clicking on the searched result.

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the following steps were taken to implement the testing for the ExpandTesting Automation website:

In this project, we automated the login functionality, search functionality, and clicking on the searched result for the ExpandTesting Automation website. 

We wrote test cases for each functionality and used Selenium WebDriver to automate the tests.

This project provided a great opportunity to practice automation testing using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

We hope that this project has been helpful in improving your automation testing skills and that you can use these skills to automate other websites and applications.

Thank you for following along with this project, and happy testing!
